# Non-ergodic Ground Motion Models For California

This repository contains regression codes and model implementations for the effective amplitude Spectrum (EAS) and Pseudo-Spectral Acceleration (PSA) Non-ergodic ground motion models (NGMM) for California presented in:
- Lavrentiadis, G., Abrahamson, N. A., & Kuehn, N. M. (2021). A non-ergodic effective amplitude ground-motion model for California. Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering, 1-32.
- Lavrentiadis, G., & Abrahamson, N. A. (2023). A non-ergodic spectral acceleration ground motion model for California developed with random vibration theory. Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering, 1-27.

Subdirectory `Analyses\regression` contains the regression code for the NGMMs, while the subdirectory `Analyses\model_implementation` contains the models implemented in Python.
Supporting files for evaluating the models, including the spatially varying coefficients, anelastic attenuation grid, anelastic attenuation cell values, and adjustments to the back-bone ergodic models, can be accessed through the project's [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1katzE3Bz8kntWTCzKU8KGls-H6I16Mu4?usp=sharing)
